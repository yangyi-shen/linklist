# linklist

A rough, significantly simplified copy of del.icio.us. The goal is to both provide a nifty project for my portfolio, and create a little platform where people can engage in social bookmarking. 

# todo-list:

- [x] Create Node.js Typescript backend
- - [x] Create database schemas (.ts files that just export interfaces) for Users, LinkLists
- - [x] Set up CRUD with Firebase Realtime Database (bothersome!)
- - [x] Set up CRUD APIs with Express
- [ ] Create React Typescript frontend
- - [ ] Set up Vercel hosting
- - [x] Create homepage that fetches list of most recently added links
- - [x] Create personal page with own list of links + field to add new link
- - [ ] Allow users to access read-only form of personal page of other users
- - [ ] Implement responsive design (handle mobile, tablet and desktop)
